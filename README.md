# Alexa (Parody)

A simple voice assistant built with Python using speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.

## Remainder 
Never feel overwhelmed by how big systems work. Just like I did with my Alexa (parody), you can take the **"divide and conquer"** approach. Remember, Alexa is just a combination of software and some hardware! By breaking down the complexity into manageable parts, you can build your own version of a voice assistant. Each component, from voice recognition to text-to-speech, can be tackled individually, making the process approachable and fun.
